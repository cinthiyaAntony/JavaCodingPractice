**Day 1:** 
Question: Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, the task is to find whether there is a pair of elements in the array whose sum is equal to target.
1. What if there are multiple pairs that sum up to the target? How would you return all of them? Would the order of the returned pairs matter?
2. What if there is no pair that sums up to the target? How should your function handle this?
3. What if the array contains duplicate numbers? How would your solution behave? Would it return the same index twice if a number added to itself equals the target (e.g., nums = [5, 5], target = 10)? The original problem statement says you cannot use the same element twice.
4. Can you solve this problem with a time complexity better than O(n^2)?
5. Could you solve this with O(1) extra space?
6. What if the array is sorted? How would that change your approach?
7. What if the target can be formed by the sum of three numbers (Three Sum)?
8. What if the numbers in the array can be negative?
9. How would you handle very large input arrays?
10. Can you write test cases to ensure your solution is correct?
